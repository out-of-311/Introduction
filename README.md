> PEEP-Talk is an educational platform with a deep learning-based persona conversation system and a feedback function for correcting English grammar. In addition, unlike the existing persona conversation system, a Context Detector (CD) module that can automatically determine the flow of conversation and change the conversation topic in real time can be applied to give the user a feeling of talking to a real person.

> The source code is open so that you can download the source code and set it up with ease if you would like to have your own exclusive environment, and this platform is deployed by Kakao i Open Builder.



## Rules

1. Be(Èùû) Professional

2. To Be Programmable

   Good is the work process

3. Bottom-up

   Our research domain is almost advanced and further way from ML/DL basics.

4. Do not Be Shy

   We love TTL (Too Much Talker). More Personal, More involved

5. Do lot of mistakes

   We love errors. We are young, so we have to face many difficulties.



## Reason Why to Study

1. Be Prepare

   To capture the chance that go further your research.

2. To know the flow of AI algorithms

   Not only acquire the details of  how work algorithms or papers, But also we must know why these algorithms came out and where came from.
